## Why do we care

As we build our applications and demos, we'll need a way to easily make the updates and changes available for distribution.  Though we could manually build, and push from our laptops during development, these are manual steps that take time away from the actual coding.  Further... no one actually building applications works that manually.  We need to be operating like developers.
